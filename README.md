This is a website that I create with the intention of translating to portuguese-content some webnovels that I like to read in my free time.
It is very simple, but efficient and not so bothersome to update.

I used the Fetch methodology to update the chapters, so I didn't needed to always copy/paste an HTML/CSS file for each chapter.

Also, I made a dynamic URL for every chapter, and made a condition to when the site is being acessed with parsed URL it should display the right chapter, this making it possible to someone pass the copy/past the link to someone else.

It also have LocalStorage for saving the user read-mode preferences. Be it light/dark.

CONTENT PT-BR
PortuguÃªs do Brasil
